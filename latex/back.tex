\section{Deficiencies}
I should make the code more robust. For example, $w$ should be smaller than $N_{loc}$
and $M_{loc}$ mathematically. I should add some code to tell the user if they 
input the wrong parameters.

In task 4 ratio aspect effect, from model, the larger difference in $M$ and $N$,
the more total cost. However, my results has some fluctuations.

In task 5 overlapping, I use temporary buffer $utmpt$, $utmpb$, $utmpl$ and $utmpr$
to update the field values on boundaries so that we can decouple the bulk calculation
with the field values on the halo. The trade off of this approach is that we have to
copy values to this four buffers, which generates some overhead. So in some situation,
the overlapping method will be a little worse than  the non-overlapping one, although
their different is very small.

In task 8 overlapping for $P>1$, there are 4 communications in each iteration. But
only first two of them is overlapped with computation. The last two communications
don't overlap with computation. This is a deficiecy.

\section{Feedback}
In the experiments results, there is always some "fluctuations", I can't understand
what's the reason of these fluctuations, so I think it is better to know some details
on message communication, such as what's factor will affect $t_s$ and so on.
