\section{Overview}

Hongbo Zhang, u6170245. All the work are accomplished by myself independantly.

The program is developed using git from beginning, so it is possible to trace
all my codes in git. All the products, including the codes, computational results,
shell/gnuplot scripts, figures, latex and so on, can be found in git. 
The source code is well commented and There is no any warnings when compiled 
with the \lstinline{-Wall} option.

I also finished task 8. I choose to implement overlapping code for $P>1$ as
an optional task.

The report is organized as following. In next 8 sections, I answer the questions,
derive the performance models, show experiments and so on.
One section is for one task in the assignment specification. 
After that, there is a section about the deficiencies of the work,
which is followed by a feedback.
