\section{Task 1 Deadlock Issues}

According to experiment results, the code will fails due to deadlock with $M \geq 504$ for $P=1$, and $M=N$.
It will have deadlock since the all the processes are sending messages to their right neighbors and waiting for their returns.
If the message is small, the message can be packed into the initial buffer, therefore it will behave as non-blocking.
However, for larger sizes it fails. It will transit from a non-blocking send to a blocking send when the message becomes too large. 

From above experiment results, we can infer that the size of initial buffer is about \lstinline{1024*sizeof(int)}. Taking the halo data and some overheads into account, the $M$ should be smaller than $504$. However, for general $P$, $Q$, $N$ and $w$, the size of $M$ and $N$ of triggering deadlock should satisfy
\[
	\max{\left(\frac{M}{P}, \frac{N}{Q}\right)} + w \approx 512
\]

Without deploying non-blocking or buffered sends, we can change the order of sends/receives of processes. Odd processes will firstly send, then receive. Even processes will firstly receive, then send. The code can be found below.


\begin{lstlisting}[language=c] 
if ( rank % 2 == 1 ) {
  MPI_Send(&V(u, 1, N_loc), M_loc, MPI_DOUBLE, rightProc, HALO_TAG, comm);
  MPI_Recv(&V(u, 1, 0), M_loc, MPI_DOUBLE, leftProc, HALO_TAG, comm, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);
  MPI_Send(&V(u, 1, 1), M_loc, MPI_DOUBLE, leftProc, HALO_TAG, comm);
  MPI_Recv(&V(u, 1, N_loc+1), M_loc, MPI_DOUBLE, rightProc, HALO_TAG, comm, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);
} else {
  MPI_Recv(&V(u, 1, 0), M_loc, MPI_DOUBLE, leftProc, HALO_TAG, comm, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);
  MPI_Send(&V(u, 1, N_loc), M_loc, MPI_DOUBLE, rightProc, HALO_TAG, comm);
  MPI_Recv(&V(u, 1, N_loc+1), M_loc, MPI_DOUBLE, rightProc, HALO_TAG, comm, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);
  MPI_Send(&V(u, 1, 1), M_loc, MPI_DOUBLE, leftProc, HALO_TAG, comm);
}
\end{lstlisting}
